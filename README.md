#Problem statement

Design a seat booking system with the following features:

1. There are a total of 50 seats - Initially 40 to be reserved and 10 to be floating/buffer.
2. There are two batches of 40 members for a total of 80 people. There are 5 squads in each batch, with a total of 8 members per batch.
3. The sessions will be conducted on weekdays, with a biweekly system where on Week1, the reserved seats will be reserved for batch1 for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and for batch2 for Thursday and Friday. While on week2, the reverse will happen, i.e., Thursday and Friday for Batch1, and Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for batch2.
4. Floater seats can be reserved by anyone only after 3PM the day before a session, Reserved seats also need to be booked the candidates and can be done upto 2 weeks in advanced.
5. In case a person wants to vacate their reserved seat, they can do so, which will then make it turn into a temporary floater seat for that session.
6. No seats can be booked on Holidays, and weekends.
